Pure Gold repels and corals Blood, low durability, highly enchantable, not good for tools by itself
Carminite attracts Blood, high durability, low enchantability, very good for tools especially with Pure Gold

Need Some way to perform magics & make trinkets before carminite

Carminite items will have an added ability to become stronger by infusing more and more Blood
Lacunite, the void varient of all blood things and carminite

All things Carminite use 1 color schema
All organic Blood Items use a seperate color Schema

Blood is actually a living organism, scared of gold, rather than functioning as a fluid dynamic it acts out of fear

Organic Mechanics :
    All things Organism are to be treated as block machinery

Stelar Magicae :
    Stela Stones that have carved glyphs that perform on click effects at cost for blood, maybe some altar stuff too

Artifactory :
    Crafting jewelry, trinkets, armor & tools that perform long term passive effects
